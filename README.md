# ExpandImages_InSimpleWay ( https://simplifiedweb.github.io/ExpandImages_InSimpleWay/)
I made a simple Expanding Images project when we hover it Let me explain you just using html and css

Simple we have to play with css to do this.
when i'm hovering the img it should get focused and expand

simple remember this following steps.

:hover the img it should get the width and transition. 
And the text appearing was hide inside the image when we hover and expand the image then we see the text. simply
the container should position relative and the text is position absolute
based on the container set the images and when we hover set the width of img.
